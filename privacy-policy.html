            <h2>
                <b>MK Decisioning Systems, LLC Privacy Policy
			<br>Last Updated: December 15, 2017</b>
            </h2>
            <p>This policy outlines how MK Decisioning Systems, LLC (MK) handles personal information that MK collects and receives.</p>
            <p>Please note that this policy does not encompass how MK handles credit information on you that MK obtains when you register to utilize our services. How MK treats your credit information is outlined in our Terms of Service. This policy covers all other information about you that we collect and receive.</p>
            <p>This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") details our information collection practices for "online" (e.g., web and mobile services, including web and mobile sites, including <a href="https://mkdecision.com">https://mkdecision.com</a>, however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise) and "offline" (e.g., collection of data through mailings) activities ("offline" and "online" activities collectively referred to as the "Services"), which are owned, operated or made available by MK Decisioning Systems, LLC ("MK" or "we,""our" or "us"). In this Privacy Policy, we depict the types of information we collect from users of the Services and how we may use that information. This Privacy Policy also applies to your use of interactive features or downloads that: (i) we own or control; (ii) are available through the Services; or (iii) interact with the Services and post this Privacy Policy. In addition, please review our Terms of Use, which governs your use of our "online" Services.</p>
            <p>If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@mkdecision.com">info@mkdecision.com</a>.</p>
            <h3>Data We Gather</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Information You Furnish to Us</b>
            </p>
            <p>When you register with MK or use our Services, we may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, address, email address, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number or phone number ("Personal Information"). (As explained above, any information from a credit report that we obtain about you is covered in our Terms of Use, and is not included in this Privacy Policy's definition of Personal Information); and (2) demographic information, such as information about your family ("Demographic Information").</p>
            <p>In addition to other Personal Information, we collect when you register, we may collect your driver's license number and social security number as a requirement of the credit bureau to verify your identity. We use this information in order to fulfill your request to create an interest free debt obligation. We may collect Personal Information through various other forms and in various places through the Services, including contact us forms, or when you otherwise communicate with us.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Information We Collect</b>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Services ("Usage Information"). For example, MK automatically receives and records information that your browser sends whenever you visit the MK website. These server logs may include information such as your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier"), browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser from your computer or other device used to access the Services (any, a "Device"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Services, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.</p>
            <p>MK uses aggregate data collected in log files and cookies for normal purposes: to improve the Services, to personalize the advertising, launch new services, conduct research, and furnish anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. These cookies and log files do not hold your Personal Information, but they are associated to your Personal Information in our system.</p>
            <p>Below are a few ways that we may use to gather Usage Information. In the future, other new technology and methods for collecting Usage Information may be utilized.</p>
            <p>SMS/Text Communication. We may send communications to you on your mobile telephone by SMS or text message.  Message and data rates from your mobile telephone service provider may apply and are subject to the terms and conditions imposed by your provider.</p>
            <p>Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to access the Services. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built into or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many applications, including, without limitation, remembering you and your likes and tracking your visits to our web pages. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Services may not work properly. MK uses cookies when you sign in, to identify you and keep track of your personal session. All this information is securely stored, and no Personal Information is kept on your cookie. </p>
            <p>MK uses session ID cookies to improve your use of our site. Session ID cookies expire upon 30 minutes of inactivity or when you close your browser whichever is shorter. We also use a persistent cookie that stays on your hard drive for an extended period of time, so that we can identify you when you return to our web site. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file; however, because we use cookies for our sign-in functionality, if you choose to disable cookies you will not be able to log on to the MK web site.</p>
            <p>Some of our business partners utilize cookies on our site. We do not have access or authority over these cookies.</p>
            <p>Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is built to gather information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
            <p>Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code known as web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our web and mobile pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web or mobile page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of applications, including, without limitation, to count users of the Services, to monitor how users use the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie web beacons to Personal Information. We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate â€“ e.g., usage and volume statistics to enhance and improve our Web site.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Information Third Parties Provide About You</b>
            </p>
            <p>From time to time, we may supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to personalize our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may interest you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Information You Provide About A Third Party</b>
            </p>
            <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Services, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. MK stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used for communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality through our Services, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>
            <p>Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@mkdecision.com">info@mkdecision.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our servers.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Furnishing Additional Information to Third Parties</b>
            </p>
            <p>MK does not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for any use. MK only shares Personal Information with companies or individuals who are not our agents or services providers when we have your consent, or as otherwise permitted by this policy.</p>
            <p>MK can share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-Personal Information, such as the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.</p>
            <p>
                <b>When You Agree To Receive Information From Third Parties</b>
            </p>
            <p>You may be presented with an opportunity to receive an marketing offer directly from unaffiliated third parties. These offers vary from day to day, but typically if you are interested in a particular offer, you will be taken to a third party site to complete the offer. Please remember that the third parties' privacy policy oversees the collection and use of your personal information. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of  third parties and it is in your best interest to review the privacy policies and practices of such third parties before to consenting to receive such information from them. If you later determine that you no longer want to receive communication from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.</p>
            <p>On our Services, MK may serve you targeted advertisements based on your Personal Information. Advertisers on our Services may include financial service providers (such as banks, credit card providers, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as cable providers, airlines, wireless carriers and software companies). Advertisers may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet certain targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 with a certain minimum credit score. However, MK does not provide advertisers any of your Personal Information when you view or interact with a targeted offer.</p>
            <p>Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf. We may utilize third party vendors to perform certain aspects of the Services on our or your behalf, such as hosting the Services, designing and/or operating the Services' features, tracking the Services analytics, and enabling MK to send you special offers or performing other administrative services. We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us. While we may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Services and viewing of our content, we do not share Personal Information with these analytics service providers, but they may set and access their own cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including non-personal information.</p>
            <p>Co-Branded Services. Certain aspects of the Services may be provided to you in association with third parties such as our advertisers, business partners, or sponsors, and may ask you to disclose Personal Information to them. Such Co-Branded Services will identify the third party. If you chose to sign up for products and/or services through the Co-Branded Services, you may be furnishing your information to both us and the third party. Any such information provided to the third party is governed by that third party's privacy policies. Additionally, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Service with a username and password obtained through the Services, your Personal Information may be disclosed to the identified third parties for that Co-Branded Service and will be subject to their posted privacy policies.</p>
            <p>Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions. We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions through the Services that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, allowing the sponsor of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list.</p>
            <p>Administrative and Legal Reasons. We may access, use, save, move and disclose your information (including Personal Information, including disclosure to third parties: (i) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoenas, governmental requests or legal process if in our good faith opinion such is required or permitted by law; (ii) to protect and/or defend the Terms of Use for any online Services or other policies applicable to any online Services, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (iii) to protect the safety, rights, property or security of the Services or any third party; and/or (iv) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. Further, we may use IP addresses or other Device Identifiers, to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with third parties such as copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers and/or law enforcement agencies, including disclosing such information to third parties, all in our discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.</p>
            <p>Business Transfer. We may share your information, including your Personal Information, and Usage Information with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates for internal reasons. We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Services or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our membership interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including, during the course of any due diligence process.</p>
            <h3>Use of Collected Information</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Special Offers and Updates:</b>
            </p>
            <p>From time to time we will send you information on products, services, special deals, or promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications by logging into your MK account and by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Service-related Announcements:</b>
            </p>
            <p>We will send you only service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for technical improvements, we could send you an email.</p>
            <p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in intent. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account once you have completed your current debt obligation.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Customer Service:</b>
            </p>
            <p>Based upon the personal information you furnish us, we will send you a confirmation email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you via email in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.</p>
            <p>Please note that information submitted through the Services via a "contact us" or other similar function may not receive a response.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Online Behavioral Advertising and Opt-Out</b>
            </p>
            <p>We work with third-party advertising networks, publishers and other entities to advertise our products and services on websites not affiliated with us.  Some of these ads are online behavioral advertising â€“ which are advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you using non-personal behavioral information.  Such ads may contain cookies that allow monitoring of websites (including our own websites that part of our own Services) and your engagement with our advertisements. Cookies placed by these companies do not collect Personal Information. We prohibit companies that place our ads from using information for any purpose other than to assist us in our advertising. If you would like to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of network advertising programs. To do so, visit: the Network Advertising Initiative industry's opt-out page.</p>
            <p>In order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on your device, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new Device, access our Services from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.</p>
            <p>Even if you choose to remove your information (opt-out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However, the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Consent To Transfer Information To The United States</b>
            </p>
            <p>The Services are operated in the United States and intended for users located in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please note that information we gather, including, Personal Information, will be transferred to and stored in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Services or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Change or Inquire About Information And Communications Preference</b>
            </p>
            <p>It is your responsibility to maintain the accuracy of the information you furnish to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. You can access and make changes to the Personal Information you submit, including your marketing preferences, at any time by using the username and password you selected at the time of registration and making the change on our "My Profile" page. If you no longer desire our service, you may delete or deactivate it by following the instructions detailed in the Terms of Use.</p>
            <p>New categories of marketing communications might be added to the Marketing Preferences page from time to time, but we will require your consent and notice before marketing to you in this new way. We give you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having Personal Information used. For example, you can elect not to receive newsletters or alert emails. You can do this by logging into your account and visiting the "My Profile" page and you may also follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each email.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Third Party Content And Links To Third Party Services</b>
            </p>
            <p>MK may post links to third party web sites that are not subject to this privacy policy. We do not exercise control over the external sites. These sites may place their own cookies or other files on your Device, collect data, web site usage information and your Device Identifier when web pages from the Services are served to your browser, or solicit Personal Information from you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any of these third parties. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you away from the Services onto a different web site. These other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. We encourage you to note when you leave our Services and to read the privacy statements of all third party web sites or applications before submitting any Personal Information to third parties.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Publicly Disclosed Information</b>
            </p>
            <p>The Services may permit you to submit ideas, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Information (collectively,"User Content"), that is publicly viewable (such as on public portions of your user profile). We or others may reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed). Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties across the Internet. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in connection with your User Content.</p>
            <p>Note that MK does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that you disclose publicly or share with others, whether through the Services or otherwise. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any content or information that you disclose or receive through the Services.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Account Terminiation</b>
            </p>
            <p>Because MK is a financial services company, there are certain legal reporting and information retention requirements with which we must comply, particularly if you are still in the midst of a debt obligation that you created. Therefore, we cannot delete your account information outright. However, we will encrypt your information and disable your account, which will be inactive and not available to anyone other than MK authorized personnel. </p>
            <p>
                <b>Security</b>
