                <b>Services</b>
            </p>

You understand that such services may provide for fees, charges, limitations and restrictions which might impact your use of the Services (e.g., data use charges, etc.), and you agree to be solely responsible for all such fees, charges, limitations and restrictions. You agree that only your mobile service provider is responsible for the performance and operation of its products and services, including your mobile device and the mobile service provider's own network.

            <p>MK Decisioning Systems, LLC, 233A Street, San Diego, CA 92101</p>

            <p>When you contact us about an error or an unauthorized transaction, you may be asked to provide us with the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and the e-mail address associated with your MK Account;</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Conduct an investigation to determine whether there has been an unauthorized transaction or error.</li>
                <li>We will attempt to determine whether an error or unauthorized transaction occurred within ten (10) Business Days after we hear from you. If more time is needed to process your claim, we may take up to thirty (30) days to investigate your grievance or question. Notification will be given to you if more time is needed.</li>
                <li>We will tell you the results of our investigation within three (3) Business Days after its completion. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If we determine that there was no error and/or unauthorized transactions, we will send you a written explanation via email of our justification.</p>
            <p>In the event that we do find issues of error and/or instances of unauthorized transactions, we will promptly correct the error by appropriately crediting or debiting the bank account on file. If a credit is issued to your account, the credit will take 2-3 business days from the date of determination to process.</p>
            <p>
                <b>MK Processing Errors</b>

            <p>MK will take the appropriate actions needed to rectify any error that we discover or that is brought to our attention. If the error resulted in you receiving less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, MK will credit your bank account for the difference. If the error resulted in you receiving more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, MK will debit the extra funds from your registered bank account.</p>
            <p>MK reserves the right to waive liability if it is determined that (a) our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction, or (b) circumstances beyond our control (such as fire, flood or loss of Internet connection) prevented the transaction, despite our reasonable precautions, (c) notification was not given to MK in a timely fashion as per our Notification Terms (above), (d) other exceptions allowed by law or provided in our agreement with you.</p>
            <p>

You further authorize CSIdentity Corporation and its agents and employees to obtain various information and reports about you (or about your child that you have enrolled, if applicable) in order to provide the services, including, but not limited to, address history reports, name and alias reports, criminal reports or sex offender reports, and to provide monitoring and alerts.</p>
            <p>The third-party lender will report loan repayments made by you credit reporting agencies ("CRAs"), which in part is designed to assist parties in establishing a credit history.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the above, any party may dispute any entry on a credit report provided by MK to a CRA. Please see the "Dispute of Credit Reporting Information by Customer" section, below.</p>
            <p>MK is not responsible for how any CRA may manage or use the information provided to them by MK and you agree to hold MK harmless against any such claims, with all being subject to the "Dispute of Credit Reporting Information by Customer" section of these Terms and Conditions and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. See such CRA for the terms and conditions of how they collect, store, manage, use, modify, disseminate and distribute such information. Once the information is transmitted from MK to the CRA, that CRA will obtain an ownership interest in that data.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Potential Effect of Delinquency of Credit Reporting</b>
            </p>
            <p>Once payment by a customer for a particular loan repayment has been reported to a CRA, the delinquency of a payment may negatively impact a customer's credit history. MK shall not be liable for any claims, charges, demands, damages or adverse impacts on a customer's credit score or credit history if a customer ceases using MK's services and does not complete a loan repayment or has default payments.</p>
            <h3>Dispute of Credit Reporting Information by Customer</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Notice of Dispute</b>

            </p>
            <p>Upon receipt of a notice of dispute from a customer, MK and a third-party financial institution partner will, free of charge, conduct a reasonable investigation and make a determination of the status of the disputed information within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of the notice of dispute from the customer. The investigation shall include, but is not limited to, all relevant information provided by the customer. The determination shall be one of the following three options:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The dispute is frivolous or irrelevant and the information originally provided is accurate;</li>
                <li>The disputed information is inaccurate; or</li>
                <li>More information is necessary to make a final determination regarding the disputed information.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <b>Notification of Determination</b>
            </p>
            <p>Once a final determination has been made regarding the disputed information, MK will notify the customer for that purpose, by other means available to MK and/or a third-party financial institution within five (5) business days of the determination regarding the disputed information. If MK determines that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, MK and/or a third-party financial institution shall notify the customer by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by other means available to MK and/or a third-party financial institution. Said notice shall include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The reasons for the determination; and</li>
                <li>Identification of any information required to investigate the disputed information.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If MK and/or a third-party financial institution determines that the disputed information is inaccurate, MK and/or a third-party financial institution shall notify the customer by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by other means available to MK and/or a third-party financial institution within five (5) business days of the determination and will promptly notify all CRA's to which MK provided said information and request that they delete or modify the information as appropriate. If MK and/or a third-party financial institution determines that more information is necessary to complete its investigation, MK and/or a third-party financial institution will notify the customer, and the customer's counterparty if necessary, and request additional information from them to help make a final determination as to the disputed information.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Additional Information Request</b>
            </p>
            <p>Upon receipt of the additional information, MK and/or a third-party financial institution shall make a final determination on the disputed information, considering all information provided by all parties, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice of dispute by MK and/or a third-party financial institution under this section. Notice of said determination shall be forwarded to the customer as described above.</p>

            <p>
                <b>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</b>
            </p>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions shall be subject to and construed under the laws of the State of Texas, without reference to the conflicts of law provisions thereof.</p>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions contain a pre-dispute arbitration clause, which applies to these Terms and Conditions. By clicking "Agree" and consenting to these Terms and Conditions, MK and you agree as follows:</p>
            <li>All parties to these Terms and Conditions are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed.</li>
            <li>Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.</li>
            <li>The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.</li>
            <li>The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court.</li>
            <p>Pre-dispute arbitration clause: You understand and agree that all claims, disagreements, disputes or controversies between you and MK, and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and/or related companies, including related to the Services, shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration. Because the Services provided to you by MK concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance of any disputes. The arbitration shall take place in Austin, Texas. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with Title 9 of the US Code (United States Arbitration Act) under the AAA's Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures as supplemented by the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (and as stated therein, if there is a difference between the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures, the Supplementary Procedures will be used). Neither you nor we shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against other customers/consumers or arbitrate any claim as a representative or member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. The parties voluntarily and knowingly waive any right they have to a jury trial.</p>
            <p>NO CLASS ACTIONS. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that any and all disputes, claims and causes of action you may against MK in connection with or related to the Services will be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action.</p>
            <p>You and MK agree that any controversy or claim between You and MK, or between You and any of the officers, employees, agents, or affiliated companies of MK, arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions, any of the transactions contemplated under these Terms and Conditions, any of the Services provided pursuant to these Terms and Conditions, any of the discussions or negotiations leading up to the making of these Terms and Conditions, or any relationship that results from any of the foregoing, whether based in contract, or an alleged tort, or on any other legal theory, and whether asserted as an original or amended claim, counterclaim, cross claim, or otherwise, shall be governed by federal law and all applicable substantive laws of the State of Texas (without regard to its conflict of laws principles).  Governing Texas law may be supplemented as necessary by federal law.  You agree that if there is any inconsistency between the terms of these Terms and Conditions and any applicable law, regulation or rule, the terms of these Terms and Conditions will prevail to the extent any such law, regulation or rule may be modified by agreement.</p>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no action, regardless of form, arising out of these Terms and Conditions may be brought by either party more than two (2) years after the claiming party knew or should have known of the cause of action.  </p>
            <p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and MK as a result of these Terms and Conditions or accessing the Services. MK's performance under these Terms and Conditions is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms and Conditions is in derogation of MK's right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your access or use of the Services or information provided to or gathered by MK with respect to such use.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Interpretation</b>
            </p>
            <p>If any part of these Terms and Conditions is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations contained herein, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms and Conditions shall continue in effect.  A printed version of these Terms and Conditions and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms and Conditions to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. Except as otherwise speciﬁed in these Terms and Conditions, all notices, permissions and approvals hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given upon: (i) personal delivery, (ii) the second business day after mailing, (iii) the second business day after sending by conﬁrmed facsimile, or (iv) the ﬁrst business day after sending by email. Notices to us must be sent in writing to the following address: 233A Street, San Diego, CA 92101 or via email addressed to: <a href="mailto:info@mkdecision.com">info@mkdecision.com</a> and notices to you will be sent to the email address you provide to us, which addresses may be updated from time to time upon written notice to the other party. The Services, Content, other technology we may make available, and derivatives thereof may be subject to laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. No forbearance or delay by either party in enforcing its rights shall prejudice or restrict the rights of that party and no waiver of any such rights or of any breach of any contractual terms shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other right or of any later breach. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise. We may assign our rights and privileges under these Terms and Conditions (including your customer registration), without your consent in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or to an afﬁliate, or in connection with a change in control. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms and Conditions shall bind and inure to the beneﬁt of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>

MK also reserves the right to terminate your participation at any time, in MK's absolute discretion, without cause.    Sections titled "Content and Materials," "Warranties, Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability," "Applicable Law and Jurisdiction," "Interpretation," and "Indemniﬁcation," and this Section shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms and Conditions.</p>

            <p>These Terms and Conditions represent the entire understanding between you and MK governing the Services.
